# Welcome to my Portfolio!

## Whats in the code?
The index.html file contains the HTML markdown of my portfolio page. Within the assets/css/styles.css file, lies the styling used and applied to the html file.

## Desktop View
The desktop view of my portfolio follows a standard layout, consisting of a horizontal navbar, a header containing a profile picture, an about me section, project section, and lastly, a contact section. 

## Responsiveness in Tablets/Mobile
Custom breakpoints were added to add responsiveness in the event an individual views my portfolio in mobile or tablet format. Notible changes include the removal of the heading depending on viewport width, as well as the stacking of the navbar on sufficiently small devices.
